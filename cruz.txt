QUESTIONS:

1. Who will you most tie yourself to?
	a. Trump (-4, -0.7) {"This will not help in crucial suburbs like Tarrant and Harris Counties!"}
	b. Republicans generally (-2.5, -0.7) {"It is a GOP mid-term, so this is not a good strategy."}
	c. Sen. Majority Whip John Cornyn (-0.1, 0.2) {"This is your best choice; Cornyn is a popular Texan senator."}
	d. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (-3, -2) {"McConnell is uncharismatic and unpopular."}
	e. Total outsider! (-4, -3) {"You are the incumbent..."}
2. What will be your general strategy for the campaign?
	a. Run as an outsider (-2, -1) {"You are the incumbent!"} 
	b. Mention your failed presidential campaign (-1.5, -0.5) {"People have already forgotten about it, and that's good because your 180 on Trump since then."}
	c. Attack attack attack! (-2, -1) {"This does not satisfy moderates. The only people who hate Beto will vote for you anyway."}
	d. Point at your record (-3, -1) {"Good move, though some of your moves have been unpopular, such as your fillibustering."}
3. What is your ideology?
	a. Moderate (-2, 0) {"The GOP is quite right wing, and the base is displeased, but this helps with moderates."}
	b. Establishment Republican (-1.5, -0.5) {"You were an outsider 6 years ago; also, the Republicans are not popular now."}
	c. Firebrand conservative (-2, -1) {"This does not help with moderate suburbanites."}
4. Who are you trying to appeal to?
	a. Rural Hispanics in the R.G.V. (-0.6, 2) {"But you want to deport these people..."}
	b. Rural voters in places such as the Panhandle (-2, -1) {"Barely anyone lives there, and most will vote for you."}
	c. Urban Hispanics in places such as El Paso and San Antonio (-1, 1) {"Interesting strategy, since you're Hispanic."}
	d. Suburbanites in places such as Fort Bend County (0.2, 1) {"Best choice."}
5. Which GOP representative would you like to campaign with?
	a. Louis Gohmert, the very conservative representative of the rural, GOP 1st District (-1.4, -0.8) {"Did you miss the part about him being extremely conservative and the district being extremely rural and conservative?!"}
	b. Will Hurd, an ethnic moderate who represents the competitive 23rd district (which covers more of the US-Mexico border than any district) (-1.5, 1.5) {"This helps with Hispanics and in the massive 23rd district - but it hurts with the base, who dislike how moderate Hurd is on Trump and other issues."}
	c. Kenny Marchant, who represents the 24th district (trending leftward, based in DFW suburbs such as Irving) (0.3, 1) {"He's a backbencher and represents the sorts of suburban voters you need to win."}
